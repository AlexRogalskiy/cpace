# cpace
cpace is a tool that helps develop [.c] and [.cpp] based applications by automatically restarting them when file changes in the directory are detected. The library was built to automate the generation of C/C++ .exe files when writing .c/.cpp applications.

cpace does **not** require *any* additional changes to your code or method of development.



# Requirements
* `Node.js` must be installed on your PC ([how to install](https://nodejs.dev/learn/how-to-install-nodejs) / [download](https://nodejs.dev/download))
* `gcc`/`g++` must be installed on your PC ([how to install](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXW2VLrQ3Bs) / [download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw))


# Installation
The best way to install cpace is using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cpace):

```bash
npm install -g cpace
```
cpace will be installed globally to your system path.
With a global installation cpace will be available anywhere.

You can also install cpace as a development dependency:
```bash
npm install --save-dev cpace
```
With a local installation, cpace will not be available in your system path or you can't use it directly from the command line.



# Usage

cpace wraps your application, so you just have to pass your file name:

```bash
# for C files
cpace [file.c]

# for C++ files
cpace [file.cpp]
```

For CLI options, use the `-h` (or `--help`) argument:
```bash
cpace -h
```

For compilation without starting the program, use the `-c` (or `--compile`) argument:
```bash
cpace -c [file.cpp]
```

For watching a directory and compiling specific file, use the `-d` (or `--directory`) argument:
```bash
# the file name must be after the -d argument
cpace {directory} -d [file.cpp]
```

Also, you can use several arguments:
```bash
cpace {directory} -d [file.cpp] -—Å
# or
cpace {directory} -c -d [file.cpp]
```



## Automatic re-running
cpace was written to restart C and C++ applications. If your script exits cleanly, cpace will continue to monitor the file and restart it if there are any changes.
